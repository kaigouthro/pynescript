// src/types.js

// Update existing types here...
// For example, if there was a type `Number` that only supported integers, 
// and the new language feature includes support for floating point numbers, 
// the `Number` type would need to be updated to handle floating point numbers as well.

// Add new types here...
// For example, if the new language feature includes support for tuples, 
// a new type `Tuple` would need to be added.
