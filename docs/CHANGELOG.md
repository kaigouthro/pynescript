### Understanding Language Features and Syntax
Analyzed the information from the `docs/manual 2023 - 10` to understand all the new language features and syntax introduced in the latest version of the language. This involved a thorough review of the documentation and code snippets provided.

### Updating Parsers
Updated the parsers in the `src` directory to accommodate the new language features and syntax. This included:
1. Updating the existing parsing rules to handle new syntax.
2. Adding new parsing rules to handle new language features.
3. Ensuring that the parsers can handle both the old and new syntax.

### Updating Lexers
Updated the lexers in the `src` directory to recognize the new language features and syntax. This included:
1. Updating the existing tokenization rules to handle new syntax.
2. Adding new tokenization rules to handle new language features.
3. Ensuring that the lexers can handle both the old and new syntax.

### Updating Types
Updated the types in the `src` directory to support the new language features and syntax. This included:
1. Updating the existing types to handle new language features.
2. Adding new types to handle new language features.
3. Ensuring that the types can handle both the old and new language features.

### Testing and Validation
Tested the updated parsers, lexers, and types to ensure they work correctly with the new language features and syntax. This included:
1. Creating new test cases to validate the new language features and syntax.
2. Updating existing test cases to accommodate the new language features and syntax.
3. Running all test cases and fixing any issues that arose.

### Work Breakdown
Broke down the work into small, manageable tasks to ensure thoroughness and efficiency. This included:
1. Planning the work and estimating the time required for each task.
2. Tracking progress and adjusting the plan as necessary.

### Documentation
Documented all changes made to the parsers, lexers, and types in the `src` directory. This included:
1. Documenting the reasons for the changes.
2. Documenting the changes themselves.
3. Documenting their impact on the overall system.
4. Updating the project documentation to reflect the new language features and syntax.
